# Problem 5: Blockchain
# Design Choice:
I've used **Doubly Linked List** as a Blockchain where each block represents a node in the blockchain. Used this data structure because pop and append of an element in DLL is O(1).

# Time complexity:
**O(1)** to add or pop a Block in BlockChain.
# Space complexity:
**O(n)** to hold n number of blocks
