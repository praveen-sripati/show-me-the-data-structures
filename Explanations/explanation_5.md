# Problem 5: Blockchain
# Design Choice:
I've used **Doubly Linked List** as a Blockchain where each block represents a node in the blockchain. Used this data structure because pop and append of an element in DLL is O(1). Therefore, the time complexity of this problem would be O(1).

# Time complexity: O(1)
# Space complexity: O(n)
